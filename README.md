**Required Libraries**

Dependencies:
  - newman
  - newman-reporter-htmlextra

To install all the dependencies open a terminal in the project folder and run:
  
    npm install
    
 
**Run Project**

To be able to execute the project successfully it is required to send by parameter to the script the access token.

    access_token='EAAAELxLPGQlZK3GLH1pwZawY0oGgvpFpZ56SqFM7ArUmnJLgm9RcN9yhBHGYnbQ'

To execute the complete project use the npm run command:

    npm run backend-test-all -- access_token='EAAAELxLPGQlZK3GLH1pwZawY0oGgvpFpZ56SqFM7ArUmnJLgm9RcN9yhBHGYnbQ'
    
To execute the create several payment script use the npm run command:

    npm run create-several-payments -- access_token='EAAAELxLPGQlZK3GLH1pwZawY0oGgvpFpZ56SqFM7ArUmnJLgm9RcN9yhBHGYnbQ'


**Test Execution Reports**

The execution will create an HTML report in folder ./reports
  - backend-test-all will generate:
  
        Square_Payments_API-{timestamp}.html
        
        
**Data Set**

The ./dataSet/data.js file was defined to fulfill the bonus requirement to call an external file to generate several payments, the file is empty because the data is generated randomly and dynamically in the pre-request script section in postman.  when create-several-payments script is called internally this script calls the data.js file and use the data defined there to populate the API call, I left it empty as this info is autogenerated but the number of iterations is in line with the number of data sets defined in the file, additionally, you can add -n < number > to the script, with this option you are explicitly adding the number of iterations you want to execute.
